</p>

Using the code action "Extract to Fluent files" you can easly extract a string to from source code to all FTL files on your project.<br />
To open the code action menu, you should select a string (including its quotes) and then type `âŒ˜ + .` (or `Ctrl + .`).

You can change the replacement template using the configuration `vscodeFluent.replacementTemplate`.

By default, the message will be added to all Fluent files on the workspace. But if you are working on a workspace with multiple projects, and each project has its Fluent files, you won't want mix messages between the projects. To avoid that, you should use the configuration `vscodeFluent.projects`, and add on it each projects's root path. See the bellow image for an instance.
